<p>Hi {user.displayName}!</p>
<p>We're in the process of planning what will be included in the next Red Hat Build of Quarkus feature release (codename: Fireball) and the following feature release (codename: something beginning with 'G').</p>
<p>A November release date is currently being targeted for Fireball. This means it will likely be based on a Quarkus upstream release from September or maybe October.</p>
<p>You have the following JIRA issues assigned to you that are NOT currently planned for any RHBQ released. Please can you set the fix version based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>2.y-Fireball.GA:</b> Issues that can be fixed upstream around September or October 2022. In the case of issues not requiring an upstream code change, you will have until around November 2022.</li>
    <li><b>x.y-G.GA:</b> Issues that can be fixed for the following RHBQ feature release (merge upstream ~February 2023, or ~March for non-upstream impacting issues)</li>
    <li><b>Later.GA:</b> Issues that are valid and complete, but can't be fixed in either of the above timeframes</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for your help with this.</p>
